    "text": "Abstract\nDiscovering causal relationships and testing theoretical mechanisms is a core endeavor of social science. Randomized experiments have long served as a gold standard for making valid causal inferences, but most of the data social scientists work with is observational and non-experimental. However, with newer methodological developments in economics, political science, epidemiology, and other disciplines, an increasing number of studies in social science make causal claims with observational data. As a newer interdisciplinary field, however, nonprofit studies has lagged behind other disciplines in its use of observational causal inference. In this article, we present a hands-on introduction and guide to design-based observational causal inference methods. We first review and categorize all studies making causal claims in top nonprofit studies journals over the past decade to illustrate the field’s current of experimental and observational approaches to causal inference. We then introduce a framework for modeling and identifying causal processes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and provide a walk-through of the assumptions and procedures for making inferences with a range of different methods, including matching, inverse probability weighting, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, and instrumental variables. We illustrate each approach with synthetic and empirical examples and provide sample R and Stata code for implementing these methods. We conclude by encouraging scholars and practitioners to make more careful and explicit causal claims in their observational empirical research, collectively developing and improving quantitative work in the broader field of nonprofit studies."

    "text": "Abstract\nForeign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver foreign aid. However, states are increasingly relying on repressive legislation to crack down on NGOs within their borders. How have foreign aid donors responded to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues, and channeling more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs. While our findings challenge existing notions of foreign aid running on “autopilot,” they also have worrying implications for Western donors and domestic NGOs working on contentious issues."

    "text": "Abstract\nAs space for civil society has closed around the world, transnational NGOs have faced a crisis of funding. We explore how NGOs have shifted from traditionally Northern funding sources toward grassroots private philanthropic money. How do individual donors in the US feel about donating to legally besieged NGOs abroad? Do legal restrictions on NGOs influence donors’ decision to donate? We use a conjoint survey experiment to argue that domestic political environments of NGO host countries influence preferences of private donors and that legal crackdowns on NGOs serve as a heuristic of organizational deservingness."

This article presents a simple conceptual framework to describe a vast array of estimands which are reported under imprecise and inconsistent terminology across disciplines: predictions, marginal predictions, marginal means, marginal effects, conditional effects, slopes, contrasts, risk ratios, etc. We introduce marginaleffects, an R package which offers a simple and powerful interface to compute all of those quantites, and to conduct hypothesis tests on them. marginaleffects is lightweight; extensible; it works well in combination with other R packages; and it supports over 70 classes of models, including Generalized Linear, Generalized Additive, Mixed Effects, and Bayesian models."

    "text": "Introduction\n\n\nNon-communicable diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Efforts are being made to understand the factors associated with these diseases with the aim of proposing effective public policies that contribute to their reduction.\n\n\nMethodology\nProblem: What is the status and factors associated with non-communicable diseases in Peruvian consumers?\nObjective: To characterize the status and factors associated with non-communicable diseases in Peruvian consumers.\nTarget population: People over 15 years of age.\nData Base: INEI, Endes 2022\nMeasurement: Health and Household Questionnaire\nData preprocessing:\n\n\nDownload modules 1640 and 1629 of the Demographic and Family Health Survey in csv format.\n\n\nChange commas to dots in the CSALUD01 and RECH0 DBs. SQL considers the dots as referring to decimals, the comma interprets it as a strange character. When you download the INEI database, the decimals are separated by commas. Modify it with notepad or another tool.\n\n\n\n\nResults\n1. Open pgAdmin 4\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new database\n\n\n\n\n3. Name the project and save.\n\n\n\n\n4. We will have the database created.\n\n\n\n\n5. We will open a Query Tool\n\n\n\n\n6. Now we will open the attached file\n\n\n\n\n7. You can see the document ProyectoQuery.sql\n\n\n\n\n8. Now we can read the data in postgreSQL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIt is possible to analyze INEI databases using PostgreSQL."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Authoritarian restrictions on domestic and international civil society have increased over the past decade, but authoritarian states continue to allow—and even invite—NGOs to work in their countries. Though the services and advocacy provided by NGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of authoritarian regimes, the majority of autocratic states allow NGO activities, and NGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions and attempts to limit their activities. This chapter examines the theories about and the experiences of domestic and international NGOs working in authoritarian countries. The review is premised on the theory of authoritarian institutions: dictators delegate political authority to democratic-appearing institutions in order to remain in power and maintain stability. After providing a brief overview of authoritarian institutionalism and balancing, I discuss how domestic and international NGOs fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. I then look at three forms of state–NGO relationships in the context of authoritarianism and explore how autocrats have addressed and regulated international NGOs in particular. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes."

    "text": "Authoritarian restrictions on domestic and international civil society have increased over the past decade, but authoritarian states continue to allow—and even invite—NGOs to work in their countries. Though the services and advocacy provided by NGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of authoritarian regimes, the majority of autocratic states allow NGO activities, and NGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions and attempts to limit their activities. This chapter examines the theories about and the experiences of domestic and international NGOs working in authoritarian countries. The review is premised on the theory of authoritarian institutions: dictators delegate political authority to democratic-appearing institutions in order to remain in power and maintain stability. After providing a brief overview of authoritarian institutionalism and balancing, I discuss how domestic and international NGOs fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. I then look at three forms of state–NGO relationships in the context of authoritarianism and explore how autocrats have addressed and regulated international NGOs in particular. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments have imposed restrictions on movement, association, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. In many cases, such as New Zealand, these emergency measures have been temporary and respect for human rights has returned to normal. In many other instances, however, governments have used these restrictions to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. Systematically measuring the consequences of COVID restrictions, however, is a difficult task. We will examine two possible quantitative measures of the relationship between of COVID restrictions and civil society space. First, we will use the Variety of Democracy project’s newly released Pandemic Violations of Democratic Standards Index to explore if and how civil society restrictions predict pandemic backsliding. Second, while many countries sign international human rights treaties that ostensibly bind states to respect rights, several treaties allow for emergency derogations from these obligations. We will tabulate formal human rights treaty derogations due to the pandemic and explore whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights. We hope that our exploration of these two measures will provide rich data-based descriptions of the relationship between COVID restrictions and civic space that will allow for more causal work in the future."

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the past decade, international NGOs (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. Though these services and advocacy can challenge the legitimacy and power of the regime, many autocratic states permit INGO activities and INGOs continue to work in these countries despite the sometimes heavy restrictions on their activities. In my dissertation, I theorize that this relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of amicable contempt, where each party is aware that the other threatens—yet sustains—their existence. Autocrats and INGOs engage in a dance of cost-benefit calculus, each trying to advance their own agenda without upsetting their counterpart. Regimes work to set the optimal level of INGO regulations, maximizing the practical and reputational benefits that INGOs provide and minimizing the potential destabilizing costs of INGO activities. Meanwhile, INGOs work to find the optimal mix of programming within a country that allows them to pursue their principled objectives within the boundaries the regime has set—affecting as much change and providing as many services as possible without risking expulsion from the country. I use evidence from a global survey of international NGOs to define each INGO-related element of the theory of amicable contempt. I find that INGOs are primarily motivated by their core vision and values, but that they have to balance the pursuit of their missions with instrumental concerns such as fundraising, time, staffing, and collaboration. These concerns both limit and enable INGO activities—without substantial instrumental resources and programmatic flexibility, organizations are unable to carry out their mission, while too much emphasis on resource concerns distracts organizations from their core programming and reduces their effectiveness."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political science have developed largely within the frequentist framework (i.e., Blackwell and Glynn 2018; Imai and Kim 2019; Torres 2020). In this article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the estimation of causal effects (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020; Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). Extending the approach to causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under selection on observables introduced by Blackwell and Glynn (2018), we develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the context of parametric survival analysis and linear mixed effects models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed method."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nChina’s 2017 Overseas NGO (ONGO) Law is part of a larger global trend of legal restrictions on international NGOs (INGOs). However, the effects of this global crackdown on INGOs have been difficult to measure since there is often divergence between the formal de jure regulations and the de facto implementation of these laws. The enforcement of these laws also depends on the services provided by these organizations. In particular, authoritarian regimes display conflicting attitudes towards claim-making (e.g. advocacy) INGOs versus service-providing (e.g. humanitarian assistance) INGOs. In this paper, we measure the effect of China’s ONGO law on INGO operations since 2017. We test how INGO operational flexibility under the ONGO law is influenced by organizations’ issue areas. We argue that service provision INGOs have greater flexibility and are allowed to work in a larger number of provinces than their claim-making counterparts. China provides an excellent setting for testing our claim—the 2017 ONGO law regulates both claim-making and service-providing NGOs, and ambiguity in the law gives ample room for arbitrary discretion by authorities. We test our argument using multilevel Bayesian models with administrative data from 635 registered representative offices of INGOs registered in China between 2017–2021. Our results speak to the broader literature on closing civic space and provide an empirical illustration of the practical effect of NGO restrictions on global civil society."
