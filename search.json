In this paper, we propose an agent-based model describing the management of tasks within a project using earned value assessment and a task board. Our model illustrates how EVM yields an efficient method to measure a project’s performance by comparing actual progress against planned activities, thus facilitating the formulation of more accurate predicted estimations. As proof of concept, we leverage our implementation to calculate EVM performance indexes according to a performance measurement baseline (PMB) in a task board fashion."

    "text": "In today’s dynamic business landscape, understanding and analyzing workplace environments play a pivotal role in organizational success. Companies that prioritize employee well-being, foster a positive work culture, and invest in employee satisfaction often outperform their peers. One valuable resource for gaining insights into such exemplary workplace practices is the annual “Great Place to Work” list, which highlights the best workplaces globally.\nCreating a web scraper using RStudio to extract data from the Great Place to Work website offers a powerful means of accessing and analyzing this valuable information. By harnessing the capabilities of R and its diverse ecosystem of packages, you can automate the extraction of data on workplace rankings, employee counts, industry trends, and geographical locations. This information can be harnessed to uncover patterns, identify best practices, and make data-driven decisions in the realm of human resources, talent management, and organizational development.\nObjective: Obtain updated information on the Great Place To Work ranking of companies of the world since 2019 until 2022."

Values between 1.5 and 2.5 is ok. Therefore, in this test, we will consider it. In this study it was 2.24 which mean that is ok.\nB3.
